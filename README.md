## 1. Project Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets, an internet gateway, a NAT gateway, and VPC peering. The guide includes images for reference.

## 1.1 Objectives
The objective of this project is to **design and deploy a custom AWS VPC** that meets the following requirements:
- Create a private and public subnet to isolate internal and external resources.
- Establish secure internet access using an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for public resources.
- Enable secure outbound traffic for private subnets using a **NAT Gateway**.
- Set up proper **Route Tables** to ensure correct network traffic flow.
- Implement **VPC Peering** to allow communication between two different VPCs.

By following this guide, users will gain hands-on experience in AWS networking, which is essential for cloud infrastructure management and security best practices.

## 3. Troubleshooting (Common Issues and Solutions)

### 3.1. VPC Not Connecting to Internet
**Issue:** Instances in the VPC cannot access the internet.
**Solution:**
- Ensure an Internet Gateway is attached.
- Verify route tables include a route to `0.0.0.0/0` via the Internet Gateway.

### 3.2. Subnet Routing Issues
**Issue:** Private instances are not communicating with public instances.
**Solution:**
- Confirm that the route table for private subnets has a NAT Gateway route.
- Ensure the correct subnet associations are applied.

### 3.3. VPC Peering Not Working
**Issue:** Two VPCs are peered but cannot communicate.
**Solution:**
- Make sure both VPCs have updated route tables with the peerâ€™s CIDR block.
- Verify security groups allow inbound and outbound traffic between the VPCs.

### 3.4. NAT Gateway Connectivity Issues
**Issue:** Instances in a private subnet cannot access the internet.
**Solution:**
- Verify NAT Gateway is correctly attached to the correct public subnet.
- Ensure route tables for private subnets route traffic via the NAT Gateway.
